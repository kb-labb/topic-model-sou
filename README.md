# Topic Models for SOUs

KBLab is publishing a curated dataset of Statens Offentliga Utredningar or SOUs. In order to show a possible use of the dataset, we built some topic models based on it. This [blogpost](https://kb-labb.github.io/posts/2021-05-04-topic-models-for-sous/) explains the process in more detail.  

The datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://git.kb.se/kblabb/static).

Beside the packages in the requirements, you will also need to install Mallet as explained [here](mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php). You can also swap Mallet for the python library `gensim` which is easier to install.
